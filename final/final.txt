1. The matrix need is
0 0 0 0
0 7 5 0
1 0 0 2
0 0 2 0
0 6 4 2

this system is in a safe state. The probable execute sequence is p0 p3 p1 p2 p4


2.
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('', (req, res) =>{
    const name = req.query.name;
    if(name){
        res.send(`welcome ${name}`);
    }
});

app.listen(3000, ()=>{
    console.log("the server is listening on port 3000");
});


3. For example, the Microsoft Word app needs to display what's on the page, respond to keystrokes from the user and check the spelling and grammer. This app definitely has better performance in multithreading

The other expample is Zoom, it needs to use camera to show exeryone's face and use speaker to make sound, and sometimes needs to recording. If all these threads are just run one by one, this application would be very slow.

4. For example, a math computation program which needs to calculate step by step. And every line of code we are running depends on the results of former line. In this case, the single thread is better.

If we need to sort an array or some objects, then we better use single thread. Because it depends on previous steps.

5. Short term scheduling selects processes that is in a ready state of the execution.

medium term scheduling helps to send process back to memory to reduce the level of multiprogramming

long term scheduling allow to select processes from the loads and pool back into the memory.

6. The average turnaround time is
    ((8 - 0) + (12 - 0.4) + (13 - 1)) / 3 = 10.53
